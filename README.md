# Key Inventory
While I was working, I had to do an inventory of the keys they had in the company, so I decided to create a webpage that would help me with this task.

## How to use it
1. Download the project.
2. Edit the file `credentials.php` with your database credentials (and don't forget to create the database).
3. Open the file `index.php` in your browser, or connect to the web server where you host the project.
