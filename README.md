# Key Inventory
While I was working, I had to do an inventory of the keys they had in the company, so I decided to create a webpage that would help me with this task.

## How to use it
1. Download the project.
2. Edit the file `credentials.php` with your database credentials (and don't forget to create the database).
3. Open the file `index.php` in your browser, or connect to the web server where you host the project.

## Requirements
A PHP/Web server.
*The project was made with a PHP 8 server, using a lower version might result in issues.*

A database server.
I used MariaDB on an Arch based Linux distribution. Your experience may vary if using another database server, though, normal MySQL should work fine.
